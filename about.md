# About AimBrain
AimBrain is the mobile biometric authentication platform. We help you to know if your users really are who they say they are.

The platform consists of three modalities - behavioural (tracks not only what the user enters, but also how they enter it - ready now and already trialled by major UK banks), facial and voice (ready in Q1 2016). By having multiple modalities in one package we make it very easy to have a step-up authentication mechanism within a single application. Finally, our patent-pending technology is the only one in the industry that is able to authenticate the user based on the context they are in.
